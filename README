This plugin shows album cover art for the current playing song in Rhythmbox on the desktop.
Please visit Mathias website for more information. Only problem with the original plugin is it tries to look for images locally. I just added support for the plugin to grab the cover art fetched by Cover Art plugin (which comes by default with RhythmBox, it fetches cover art from various internet sources). You have to enable that plugin first for this to work.
